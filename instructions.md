# TMDB Movie Data Analysis using Spark and APIs

**Project Overview**

```
This project challenges you to build a movie data analysis pipeline using Spark. You will fetch movie-
related data from an API, clean and transform the dataset, and implement key performance
indicators (KPIs).
```
```
This is not a group project , meaning you will design the workflow, structure the analysis, and
implement the required calculations independently.
```
**Project Objectives**

- **API Data Extraction** : Fetch movie data from a movie database API.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** : Process and structure the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : Perform an initial exploration to understand trends.
- **Advanced Filtering & Ranking** : Identify the best and worst movies based on financial and
    popularity metrics.
- **Franchise & Director Analysis** : Assess how franchises and directors perform over time.
- **Visualization & Insights** : Present key findings using visualizations.

**Project Steps**

**Step 1: Fetch Movie Data from API**

- Choose a **movie database API** (e.g., TMDb).

```
Fetch movies with ID: movie_id = [0, 299534, 19995, 140607, 299536, 597, 135397,
```
```
420818, 24428, 168259, 99861, 284054, 12445,
```
```
181808, 330457, 351286, 109445, 321612, 260513]
```
- Store the data as a Pandas **DataFrame**.

```
NB : Read the API documentation to understand the nature of the data and how it’s organized.
```
**Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

**Data Preparation & Cleaning**

1. **Drop** irrelevant columns: ['adult', 'imdb_id', 'original_title', 'video', 'homepage'].
2. **Evaluate** JSON-like columns (['belongs_to_collection', 'genres', 'production_countries',
    'production_companies', 'spoken_languages']).
3. **Extract** and clean key data points:

```
o Collection name (belongs_to_collection)
```

```
o Genre names (genres → separate multiple genres with "|").
```
```
o Spoken languages (spoken_languages → separate with "|").
```
```
o Production countries (production_countries → separate with "|").
```
```
o Production companies (production_companies → separate with "|").
```
4. **Inspect** extracted columns using value_counts() to identify anomalies.

**Handling Missing & Incorrect Data**

5. **Convert** column datatypes:

```
o 'budget', 'id', 'popularity' → Numeric (set invalid values to NaN). o 'release_date' →
```
```
Convert to datetime. o etc
```
6. **Replace unrealistic values** :

```
o Budget/Revenue/Runtime = 0 → Replace with NaN or infer from similar movies. o
```
```
Convert 'budget' and 'revenue' to million USD.
```
```
o Movies with vote_count = 0 → Analyze their vote_average and adjust accordingly.
```
```
o 'overview' and 'tagline' → Replace known placeholders (e.g., 'No Data') with NaN.
```
7. **Remove duplicates** and drop rows with unknown 'id' or 'title'.
8. **Keep** only rows where at least **10 columns have non-NaN values**.
9. **Filter** to include only 'Released' movies, then drop 'status'.

**Reorder & Finalize DataFrame**

10. **Reorder columns** :

```
['id', 'title', 'tagline', 'release_date', 'genres', 'belongs_to_collection',
```
```
'original_language', 'budget_musd', 'revenue_musd', 'production_companies',
```
```
'production_countries', 'vote_count', 'vote_average', 'popularity', 'runtime',
```
```
'overview', 'spoken_languages', 'poster_path', 'cast', 'cast_size', 'director', 'crew_size'] 11.
```
```
Reset index.
```
**Step 3: KPI Implementation & Analysis Identify the**

```
Best/Worst Performing Movies
```

1. **Filter and rank movies** based on:

```
o Highest Revenue
```
```
o Highest Budget
```
```
o Highest Profit (Revenue - Budget)
```
```
o Lowest Profit (Revenue - Budget)
```
```
o Highest ROI (Revenue / Budget) (only movies with
```
```
Budget ≥ 10M)
```
```
o Lowest ROI (only movies with Budget ≥ 10M)
```
```
o Most Voted Movies
```
```
o Highest Rated Movies (only movies with ≥10 votes)
```
```
o Lowest Rated Movies (only movies with ≥10 votes)
```
```
o Most Popular Movies
```
**Define a User-Defined Function (UDF)** to streamline ranking operations.

**Advanced Movie Filtering & Search Queries**

2. **Filter the dataset for specific queries** :

```
o Search 1: Find the best-rated Science Fiction Action
movies starring Bruce Willis (sorted by Rating -
highest to lowest).
```
```
o Search 2: Find movies starring Uma Thurman,
directed by Quentin Tarantino (sorted by runtime -
shortest to longest).
```
**Franchise vs. Standalone Movie Performance**

3. **Compare movie franchises (belongs_to_collection) vs. standalone movies** in terms of:

```
o Mean Revenue
```
```
o Median ROI
```
```
o Mean Budget Raised
```
```
o Mean Popularity
```
```
o Mean Rating
```

**Most Successful Franchises & Directors**

4. **Find the Most Successful Movie Franchises** based on:

```
o Total number of movies in franchise
```
```
o Total & Mean Budget
```
```
o Total & Mean Revenue
```
```
o Mean Rating
```
5. **Find the Most Successful Directors** based on:

```
o Total Number of Movies Directed
```
```
o Total Revenue
```
```
o Mean Rating
```
**Step 4: Data Visualization**

Visualize:

- **Revenue vs. Budget Trends**
- **ROI Distribution by Genre**
- **Popularity vs. Rating**
- **Yearly Trends in Box Office Performance**
- **Comparison of Franchise vs. Standalone Success**

**Project Deliverables**

- **Complete Workflow** : Jupyter Notebook or spark script covering data processing, analysis, and
    results.
- **Final Report** : Summary of key insights, methodology, and conclusions.
- **Efficient Code** : Clean, modular, and optimized for performance.
- **Git Best Practices** : Proper version control with clear commits and organized structure.
